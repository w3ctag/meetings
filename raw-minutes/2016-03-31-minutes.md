### Issue triage
https://github.com/w3ctag/spec-reviews/issues/110
(Generic Sensor API & Ambient Light Sensor)

TOPIC: Packaging (Yves), http://w3ctag.github.io/packaging-on-the-web/
yves: recently got input from Google as a solution for areas with poor net access.  Signing a collection of resources
...propose to move the spec into the WICG
dka: that demotes the spec from a group that can issue a thing to one that can't
yves: if we leave it where it is nowt will happen
alex: support this move
dka: does it make sense for TAG to retain involement?
alex: +1
dka: there are 14 issues against it, so what's the action? Move Jenny to historical editor, Yves to become editor, transfer repo to WICG
yves: we need to update the published version on /TR and publish it as a Note
... agree with moving the repo
dka: we shouldn't make a fork
yves: we should fork
dka: we could give perms to edit the spec in our repo
... OK let's move the repo to WICG.
... we need to make an update to the existing doc to show it's been superceded
RESOLUTION: we will cede Packaging on the Web to the WICG - Yves to make necessary edits and take on role as active editor for now.

TOPIC: Data on the web (Hadley)

hadley: there are two WGs, one I've actively involved in
... Data on the web best practices is the one I'm charing - https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/Main_Page
... three deliverables: (1) Semantic data usage 
dka: this is academic research?
hadley: not just that, also live data streams.  There's more pre-existing work in academia
... [Dataset usage vocabulary](http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/vocab-du.html)
... bar to publication for a WG note is easier than rec track, but WG wants to demo spirit of the rec track 'spirit'
... it's earlier in development than TAG would normally get involved.
dka: are there stakeholders involved in this that aren't academic?
hadly: not enough. Both reviewers are academic, needs more community involvement
(2) [Data quality vocabulary](http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/vocab-dqg.html)
hadley: addresses resistance to publish because data isn't perfect
... allows quality of data to be described. Disclaimer.

#magicdomid93
#magicdomid186
#magicdomid47
#magicdomid187
#magicdomid94
#magicdomid188

#magicdomid190
#magicdomid48
#magicdomid191
#magicdomid96
#magicdomid192
... ODI's open data certs are hard to boil down into one metric.  A lot depends on use cases.

#magicdomid247
#magicdomid124
#magicdomid248

Leonie: Want to offer some insight into problems of ARIA, helpful if TAG could take a look
#magicdomid373
#magicdomid187
#magicdomid374
#magicdomid94
#magicdomid375
#magicdomid188
#magicdomid376
... How much do people know about ARIA
#magicdomid377
#magicdomid189
#magicdomid378
#magicdomid95
#magicdomid379
#magicdomid190
#magicdomid380
Hadley: I only know the headlines
#magicdomid381
#magicdomid191
#magicdomid382
#magicdomid96
#magicdomid383
#magicdomid192
#magicdomid384
Leonie: ARIA allows you to provide semantic info where none exists.
#magicdomid385
#magicdomid193
#magicdomid386
#magicdomid97
#magicdomid387
#magicdomid194
#magicdomid388
... Some HTML elements embed semantic info, eg <h1>
#magicdomid389
#magicdomid195
#magicdomid390
#magicdomid98
#magicdomid391
#magicdomid196
#magicdomid392
... Some don't, eg div and span, and these are very very common
#magicdomid393
#magicdomid197
#magicdomid394
#magicdomid99
#magicdomid395
#magicdomid198
#magicdomid396
... A set of divs that look like tabs still just look like divs to a screen reader.  ARIA lets you fill in the gaps
#magicdomid397
#magicdomid199
#magicdomid398
#magicdomid100
#magicdomid399
#magicdomid200
#magicdomid400
... roles allow you to specify a role from a defined list.  aria- prefixed attributes extend this with specific key-value data
#magicdomid401
#magicdomid201
#magicdomid402
#magicdomid101
#magicdomid403
#magicdomid202
#magicdomid404
travis: aria-checked would be added to a checkbox, or something pretending to be a checkbox? And ARIA conveys to the screen reader whether it is checked?
#magicdomid405
#magicdomid203
#magicdomid406
#magicdomid102
#magicdomid407
#magicdomid204
#magicdomid408
Chaals: Yes, there's an API that only screen readers use
#magicdomid409
#magicdomid205
#magicdomid410
#magicdomid103
#magicdomid411
#magicdomid206
#magicdomid412
leonie: previously readers would infer from heuristics, visual cues.  Platform accessibility APIs made lower level stuff available, less guesswork involved
#magicdomid413
#magicdomid207
#magicdomid414
#magicdomid104
#magicdomid415
#magicdomid208
#magicdomid416
... from 10 years ago we started using those APIs in browsers
#magicdomid417
#magicdomid209
#magicdomid418
#magicdomid105
#magicdomid419
#magicdomid210
#magicdomid420
... if you look at a checkbox and query it using an accessibility API it should be represented the same in both places
#magicdomid421
#magicdomid211
#magicdomid422
#magicdomid106
#magicdomid423
#magicdomid212
#magicdomid424
... reader creates an accessibility tree, ARIA allows you to modify it.  Currently only supported by screen readers
#magicdomid425
#magicdomid213
#magicdomid426
#magicdomid107
#magicdomid427
#magicdomid214
#magicdomid428
... Speech recognition and other tools don't typoically use ARIA
#magicdomid429
#magicdomid215
#magicdomid430
#magicdomid108
#magicdomid431
#magicdomid216
#magicdomid432
... ARIA is very complicated, understanding implications of what you are doing is difficult
#magicdomid433
#magicdomid217
#magicdomid434
#magicdomid109
#magicdomid435
#magicdomid218
#magicdomid436
... you have to understand the relationship between your code, the dom, the browser and the assistive tech
#magicdomid437
#magicdomid219
#magicdomid438
#magicdomid110
#magicdomid439
#magicdomid220
#magicdomid440
... sometimes you can make things inaccessible by adding ARIA!
#magicdomid441
#magicdomid221
#magicdomid442
#magicdomid111
#magicdomid443
#magicdomid222
#magicdomid444
dka: what effect would an author be trying to acheive?
#magicdomid445
#magicdomid223
#magicdomid446
#magicdomid112
#magicdomid447
#magicdomid224
#magicdomid448
leonie: say an accordian, to reveal chunks of content.  Devs understand that heading hierarchy is useful,
#magicdomid449
#magicdomid225
#magicdomid450
#magicdomid113
#magicdomid451
#magicdomid226
#magicdomid452
... but headings are not interactive, so they make it a button.  Screen reader can now no longer see it as a heading, but can't tell it's interactive
#magicdomid453
#magicdomid227
#magicdomid454
#magicdomid114
#magicdomid455
#magicdomid228
#magicdomid456
chaals: a accessibility API is like a parallel DOM.  ARIA provides a way to control the things in that DOM
#magicdomid457
#magicdomid229
#magicdomid458
#magicdomid115
#magicdomid459
#magicdomid230
#magicdomid460
... people get confused between what they already have in their code and what they are modifying by using ARIA
#magicdomid461
#magicdomid231
#magicdomid462
#magicdomid116
#magicdomid463
#magicdomid232
#magicdomid464
... they put the wrong bit of ARIA in the wrong place
#magicdomid465
#magicdomid233
#magicdomid466
#magicdomid117
#magicdomid467
#magicdomid234
#magicdomid468
hadley: how is takeup of ARIA?
#magicdomid469
#magicdomid235
#magicdomid470
#magicdomid118
#magicdomid471
#magicdomid236
#magicdomid472
chaals: very widely used.  Big success, when done right (so be careful about messing with it)
#magicdomid473
#magicdomid237
#magicdomid474
#magicdomid119
#magicdomid475
#magicdomid238
#magicdomid476
alex: it's helpful to talk about who is using ARIA most.  Component library authors.  Libs are strongly ARIA-hinted.  Investments at framework level filter down.
#magicdomid477
#magicdomid239
#magicdomid478
#magicdomid120
#magicdomid479
#magicdomid240
#magicdomid480
... the more popular the component is the more pressure to get ARIA right
#magicdomid481
#magicdomid241
#magicdomid482
#magicdomid121
#magicdomid483
#magicdomid242
#magicdomid484
... ARIA provides half a toolbox, there are a series of intrinsic roles and states in HTML which are not supported by ARIA.  No way to extend it
#magicdomid485
#magicdomid243
#magicdomid486
#magicdomid122
#magicdomid487
#magicdomid244
#magicdomid488
... there's no assistive technology tree in spec land.  Chrome has one, but it's not standardised
#magicdomid489
#magicdomid245
#magicdomid490
#magicdomid123
#magicdomid491
#magicdomid246
#magicdomid492

andrew: Two problems: Devs need better tools, and need to use ARIA better
#magicdomid497
#magicdomid249
#magicdomid498
#magicdomid125
#magicdomid499
#magicdomid250
#magicdomid500
alex: plus ARIA is not extensible. I couldn't add my own nouns and verbs.
#magicdomid501
#magicdomid251
#magicdomid502
#magicdomid126
#magicdomid503
#magicdomid252
#magicdomid504
dka: what's the best way for TAG to engage?
#magicdomid505
#magicdomid253
#magicdomid506
#magicdomid127
#magicdomid507
#magicdomid254
#magicdomid508
leonie: msft has accessibiity patterns, which are extensible.  Other ideas for making ARIA extensible
#magicdomid509
#magicdomid255
#magicdomid510
#magicdomid128
#magicdomid511
#magicdomid256
#magicdomid512
dbaron: there's a fourth problem: ARIA can sometimes do things that could be relevant to all users in a way that's doesn't apply to anyone who is not using an accessibility tool.  The difference makes it harder for devs to get it right
#magicdomid513
#magicdomid257
#magicdomid514
#magicdomid129
#magicdomid515
#magicdomid258
#magicdomid516
chaals: TAG could help with creating extensibility, but main thing is trying to get things back in sync
#magicdomid517
#magicdomid259
#magicdomid518
#magicdomid130
#magicdomid519
#magicdomid260
#magicdomid520
... there's recognition that a big rethink of ARIA might not be a bad idea.  TAG should engage with that.
#magicdomid521
#magicdomid261
#magicdomid522
#magicdomid131
#magicdomid523
#magicdomid262
#magicdomid524
... also would be nice to standardise the accessibility trees
#magicdomid525
#magicdomid263
#magicdomid526
#magicdomid132
#magicdomid527
#magicdomid264
#magicdomid528
... maybe we could get that done in 10 years (if we start now)
#magicdomid529
#magicdomid265
#magicdomid530
#magicdomid133
#magicdomid531
#magicdomid266
#magicdomid532
... when users write ARIA, you have to write a set of interactions. This experience is broken, you are assuming you know what the user's keyboard is.  Sometimes you don't have enough choice
#magicdomid533
#magicdomid267
#magicdomid534
#magicdomid134
#magicdomid535
#magicdomid268
#magicdomid536
... ARIA folks are creating hard coded mapping between keys and actions like opening tabs and following links
#magicdomid537

#magicdomid135
#magicdomid539
#magicdomid270

#magicdomid554
#magicdomid139
#magicdomid555
#magicdomid278
#magicdomid556
Leonie: not publicly.  JAWS won't collaborate, but IBM are engaging, reported second hand.  Apple's voiceover and accessibility teams are pretty engaged

Chaals: What would a solution look like?  Something that would work everywhere. You say "this thing is one of those", data widget, picker etc.
#magicdomid561
#magicdomid281
#magicdomid562
#magicdomid141
#magicdomid563
#magicdomid282

#magicdomid565
#magicdomid283
#magicdomid566
#magicdomid142
#magicdomid567
#magicdomid284
#magicdomid568
... I was hoping you could take ARIA and get there from here, but I don't think it's possible, it will break existing ARIA
#magicdomid569
#magicdomid285
#magicdomid570
#magicdomid143
#magicdomid571
#magicdomid286
#magicdomid572
... could there be a small number of well defined questions, eg 'does this thing participate in form submission'

travis: ARIA 1.1 lists not only roles and states but also interaction reqs?
#magicdomid577
#magicdomid289
#magicdomid578
#magicdomid145
#magicdomid579
#magicdomid290
#magicdomid580

#magicdomid291
#magicdomid582
#magicdomid146
#magicdomid583
#magicdomid292
#magicdomid584

#magicdomid585
#magicdomid293
#magicdomid586
#magicdomid147
#magicdomid587
#magicdomid294
#magicdomid588
Chaals: Essentially that spec is an attempt to provide code for a standard set of controls.
#magicdomid589
#magicdomid295
#magicdomid590
#magicdomid148
#magicdomid591
#magicdomid296
#magicdomid592

#magicdomid299
#magicdomid598
#magicdomid150
#magicdomid599
#magicdomid300
#magicdomid600
chaals: no, screen reader will announce the role but the role does not carry any interaction.  Andrew is channeling the ignorance of the masses.

#magicdomid301
#magicdomid602
#magicdomid151
#magicdomid603

#magicdomid152
#magicdomid607
#magicdomid304

travis: contenteditable good example of an attribute that turns on lots of complex behaviour
#magicdomid609
#magicdomid305
#magicdomid610
#magicdomid153
#magicdomid611
#magicdomid306
#magicdomid612

#magicdomid614
#magicdomid154
#magicdomid615

#magicdomid617
#magicdomid309
#magicdomid618
#magicdomid155
#magicdomid619
#magicdomid310
#magicdomid620

leonie: if you want specifics, consider the password role.  Could be telling screen reader users that their password is hidden but it might still be visible if it relies on JavaScript to be obfuscated.  Also could be plainly announced by the screen reader

#magicdomid952
travis: one of the modern problems is that on Windows, alt is reserved for OS level accessibility shortcuts. You get keydown but not keyup or any subsequent key presses because it removes focus
#magicdomid953
#magicdomid477
#magicdomid954
#magicdomid239
#magicdomid955
#magicdomid478
#magicdomid956
... in FF you can use alt+shift+accesskey, but press and release alt will rob focus
#magicdomid957
#magicdomid479
#magicdomid958
#magicdomid240
#magicdomid959
#magicdomid480
#magicdomid960

hadley: the scenario you were describing, with a sensible way for the user to handle separate mappings of actions to keys from the OS, user agent, site... what would it break?

#magicdomid1054
#magicdomid264
#magicdomid1055

#magicdomid585
#magicdomid1170
#magicdomid293
#magicdomid1171
#magicdomid586

#magicdomid589
#magicdomid1178
#magicdomid295
#magicdomid1179
#magicdomid590

Alex: a coordination problem. You can take an audio stream - a media source stream - pass that into webaudio which interacts with a

#magicdomid591
#magicdomid1182
#magicdomid296
#magicdomid1183

#magicdomid593
#magicdomid1186
#magicdomid297
#magicdomid1187
#magicdomid594
#magicdomid1188
Travis: one thing I'm noticing from the stream standard is that they want to accomodate all kinds of streams. They

#magicdomid1190
#magicdomid298
#magicdomid1191
#magicdomid596

#magicdomid597
#magicdomid1194
#magicdomid299
#magicdomid1195
#magicdomid598

#magicdomid599
#magicdomid1198
#magicdomid300
#magicdomid1199
#magicdomid600

#magicdomid601
#magicdomid1202
#magicdomid301
#magicdomid1203
#magicdomid602

Alex: I think we should start with a review of byte streams: webaudio, webrtc, 
#magicdomid1205
#magicdomid603
#magicdomid1206
#magicdomid302
#magicdomid1207
#magicdomid604
#magicdomid1208
Travis: the way that this [spec] is written - it's in the style of ecmascript tc39 - it may be the intention for this to be integrated into ecmascript.
#magicdomid1209
#magicdomid605
#magicdomid1210
#magicdomid303
#magicdomid1211
#magicdomid606
#magicdomid1212
… as a language primitive this seems useful.
#magicdomid1213
#magicdomid607
#magicdomid1214
#magicdomid304
#magicdomid1215
#magicdomid608
#magicdomid1216
Alex: the intent is to augment what is in javascript with a streaming data type.
#magicdomid1217
#magicdomid609
#magicdomid1218
#magicdomid305
#magicdomid1219
#magicdomid610
#magicdomid1220
Travis: In the spec they describe 2 kinds of streams - readable stream and writable stream. Both types have built-in buffers.
#magicdomid1221
#magicdomid611
#magicdomid1222
#magicdomid306
#magicdomid1223
#magicdomid612
#magicdomid1224
… They're connected to intrinsic source or intrinsic sync. [intrinsic as in something you don't have access too - e.g. network or filesystem]
#magicdomid1225
#magicdomid613
#magicdomid1226
#magicdomid307
#magicdomid1227
#magicdomid614
#magicdomid1228
…at the most simple level you can pipe areadable stream into a writable stream. You can chain these together
#magicdomid1229
#magicdomid615
#magicdomid1230
#magicdomid308
#magicdomid1231
#magicdomid616
#magicdomid1232
…into a complex way. Signals propogate and convey a concept of back-pressure. State of the consumer so they can 
#magicdomid1233
#magicdomid617
#magicdomid1234
#magicdomid309
#magicdomid1235
#magicdomid618
#magicdomid1236
…adjust accordingly. E.g. a readable stream with a buffer of 3 - units of 1 ("chunks") - the source will start filling up
#magicdomid1237
#magicdomid619
#magicdomid1238
#magicdomid310
#magicdomid1239
#magicdomid620
#magicdomid1240
…this buffer. The signals will tell the source the total number filled in the bufffer. When you get to 0 there is some back
#magicdomid1241
#magicdomid621
#magicdomid1242
#magicdomid311
#magicdomid1243
#magicdomid622
#magicdomid1244
…pressure exerted. Sliding window built into the streams.
#magicdomid1245
#magicdomid623
#magicdomid1246
#magicdomid312
#magicdomid1247
#magicdomid624
#magicdomid1248
Tim: The goal is to fill the buffers. [referencing buffer bloat problem] - when buffers fill up everything gets slower....
#magicdomid1249
#magicdomid625
#magicdomid1250
#magicdomid313
#magicdomid1251
#magicdomid626
#magicdomid1252
…maybe the user moves on… that video or that sound will fall of the screen anyway...
#magicdomid1253
#magicdomid627
#magicdomid1254
#magicdomid314
#magicdomid1255
#magicdomid628
#magicdomid1256
Travis: the buffers are conceptual - not exposed – an implementation can optimize. Chunked delivery is reliable - same order deliver.
#magicdomid1257
#magicdomid629
#magicdomid1258
#magicdomid315
#magicdomid1259
#magicdomid630
#magicdomid1260
…an interesting concept called a tee - a splitting of a readable stream. Sigals get coalesced to create back-pressure.

#magicdomid633
#magicdomid1266
#magicdomid317
#magicdomid1267
#magicdomid634
#magicdomid1268
Travis: the blob proposal... that came out of ... describe the data in an immutable object. Then readers of blobs.… a concept that's necessary
#magicdomid1269
#magicdomid635
#magicdomid1270
#magicdomid318
#magicdomid1271
#magicdomid636

… for dealing with large data.

#magicdomid637
#magicdomid1274
#magicdomid319
#magicdomid1275
#magicdomid638
#magicdomid1276
Alex: we've made progress by making these opaque things that can "see behind the curtain" … if you don't touch the bytes there is
#magicdomid1277
#magicdomid639
#magicdomid1278
#magicdomid320
#magicdomid1279

…no need to buffer them.

#magicdomid641
#magicdomid1282
#magicdomid321
#magicdomid1283
#magicdomid642
#magicdomid1284
Travis: performance is the main driver. E.g. dealing with slower sources. Lots of async APIs can benefit.
#magicdomid1285
#magicdomid643
#magicdomid1286
#magicdomid322
#magicdomid1287
#magicdomid644
#magicdomid1288

#magicdomid1290
#magicdomid323
#magicdomid1291
#magicdomid646
#magicdomid1292
Travis: Another importan use case - transforming data. E.g. EME - you want to re-encode data as you receive it.
#magicdomid1293
#magicdomid647
#magicdomid1294
#magicdomid324
#magicdomid1295
#magicdomid648
#magicdomid1296
… the concept of EME as is is it's own streaming thing. It gets chunks of stuff… you can do ad insertion… There's a stream
#magicdomid1297
#magicdomid649
#magicdomid1298
#magicdomid325
#magicdomid1299

#magicdomid2010
#magicdomid503
#magicdomid2011
#magicdomid1006

Alex: This looks very much like an extensibility mechanism for ARIA.
#magicdomid2013
#magicdomid1007
#magicdomid2014
#magicdomid504
#magicdomid2015
#magicdomid1008
#magicdomid2016
Alex: It has the behavior of being a fallback for a request for ARIA data on an element.  If there isn't ARIA data on an element it sends this event which you can handle programatically to respond, which is really cool.
#magicdomid2017
#magicdomid1009
#magicdomid2018
#magicdomid505
#magicdomid2019
#magicdomid1010
#magicdomid2020
Alex: User intention events are sort of a recycled concept here from other proposals like Indie UI.  But this doesn't seem to come with a list of predefined intention events the same way that Indie UI did.  Also, the ARIA async thing is fundamentally new.  It says there's going to be content here, but it isn't here now, and I'll let you know when it is.
#magicdomid2021
#magicdomid1011
#magicdomid2022
#magicdomid506
#magicdomid2023
#magicdomid1012
#magicdomid2024
Alex: There's a question about extent to which virtualizing only a portion of the view -- creating elements, managing and loading data, virtualize loading behaviors through event delegation -- seems like it's crying out for something less like ARIA async and more like content async, and then have ARIA participate in that.

Alex: Let me type up my response and then...

#magicdomid1021
#magicdomid2042
#magicdomid511
#magicdomid2043
#magicdomid1022
#magicdomid2044
Alex: I'll say roughly that it feels like 3 or 4 things at once, might be good to separate.  All feel productive.  SPecifically interesting is last chance ARIA behavior with ability to handle event.  I think open questions about impact on performance of potentially bubbling those events.  Do they bubble?  If they don't bubble, easier to think about.  Even capture phase alone, deep down, may cause performance concern, b/c you may have to traverse all the way down DOM every time event handler registered.  But the ability to have programmatic ability to respond for ARIA roles and states without having to set them in the DOM a priori is pretty great.

Alex: We agreed I'd take a stab at "You misunderstood us, this is weird and a bigger fishing expedition than you thought, so we think it'll take years to specify this sanely.  So please don't include this in your spec."  Does this sound reasonable to others?

David: Should bikeshed warning link to it?
Peter: I have a note to submit PR for that, will do in next few days.
Tim: If there were a "Legal Issues" section, we could have the questionnare for that too.
Mark: We don't want to talk about the law, but could talk about policy implications of specifications.
Hadley: We talked about at lunch:  legal to-do list:  we've gone this far, but we're not covering these things.
Tim: Does this spec have behavior that could harm society.
Hadley: e.g., spam
Tim: ... fraud
?: "Societal Implications"?
Mark: We did get some questions on the security questionnare repo

Tim: shows draft reply to Jonas reflecting discussion
Peter: I think that reflects what we discussed
